goal statmnt
- i want a large clusters of symbols (hundreds) to seach for predicitive pairs/groups. Outside this proxmiity group of trading pairs I want to also use latent/centroid/average signals the ''

High-Dimensions Consequences?
• Therelativedifferenceofdistancesbetweendifferentpointsdecreases with increasing dimensionality
• Thedistancesbetweenpointscannotbeusedinordertodifferentiate between points
• Themorethedimensionalityisincreasing,themorethedatadistribution degenerates to random noise
• Allpointsarealmostequidistantfromeachother―thereareno clusters to discover in high dimensional spaces!

#  TODO hypothesis: symbols with multiple cluster assigment interesting for trading models.
